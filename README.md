TextMiningStackOverflow.R
-------------------------

Example of how to perform text mining on an unstructured dataset: The task I am addressing in this code is to predict the tags corresponding to a new question. The data I am using is available from stackoverflow (it can also be accessed from a torrent) as a XML file. The data contains questions (including titles and body text) and the tags corresponding to the questions. My code will process this data and then recommend the best tags for a new question.

Handwritten Digit Recognition using Logistic Regression
-------------------------------------------------------

In this problem, I use logistic regression and a one vs. all approach to solve a handwritten digit recognition problem. This is a multi-class classification problem and we are trying to learn a non-linear decision boundary to classify the digits correctly. 

The code can be found here: https://github.com/dspk/Rcode/blob/master/RegularizedLogisticMulti.R
